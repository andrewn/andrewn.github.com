I went along to an exhibition called "Power in Numbers" at the "Bodhi Gallery":http://bodhigallery.tumblr.com/ on Brick Lane yesterday. 40 different artists exhibited their prints, each in editions of 50.

Interestingly, all the work was the same size, and the same format. And it was all &pound;20 apart from a cool piece featuring a clock mechanism from "Mark McClure":http://www.dropcreative.co.uk/. I bought this from "I Will Create":http://iwillcreate.co.uk/2009/05/power-in-numbers-tonight.html. Mainly because I thought it was clever. I really like the contrast between the hand-drawn quality of the image, the technicality of the calculator and the funky background pattern. The image is printed in a dark green colour. [PHOTO OF PRINT] Now I just need to find somewhere to put it!

They've captured their efforts in printing and hanging in video. If you look carefully on the "first video":http://vimeo.com/4328202 -- I'm in the background attending a screen printing workshop that the "Print Club":http://www.printclublondon.com/ runs [LINK TO BLOG POST]
