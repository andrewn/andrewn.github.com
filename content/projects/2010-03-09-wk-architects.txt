Built a standards-based website with UI flourishes for this architect's practice.

The practice had an existing clean, minimal design but the site markup made updating the site with new projects a burden.

I worked with them to rebuild the pages using modern standards and added some new interactive elements such as image carousel and a slideshow of images on project pages. These features are designed to activate automatically if certain conditions are met e.g. when a certain number of images are added to the page. This means there's no technical configuration required when adding content to the site -- everything 'just works'.

The templates are built to work using the Jekyll static site publishing app, meaning that the content can be added by simply creating a new text file with the project's contents and adding some images to a directory. This makes it easy for someone in the company to add content without having to write any markup.
