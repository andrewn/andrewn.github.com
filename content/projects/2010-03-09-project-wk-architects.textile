Templates for the Wilkinson King Architects website. 

The practice had an existing clean, minimal design but a site that under the hood was showing its age. This made updating the site with new projects a burden.

I worked with them to rebuild the pages using modern standards and added some new interactive elements such as image carousel and a slideshow of images on project pages. These features are designed to activate automatically if certain conditions are met e.g. when a certain number of images are added to the page. This means there's no technical configuration required when adding content to the site -- everything 'just works.'

The templates are built to work using the Jekyll static site publishing app, meaning that the content can be added by simply creating a new text file and adding some images to a directory. Jekyll handles the rest and creates a series of static files that can be dragged onto the company's web server.
