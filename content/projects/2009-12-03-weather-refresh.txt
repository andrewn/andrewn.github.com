Iterate and improve the design and functionality of one of the UK most popular Weather sites.

The BBC Weather website is one of the most popular Weather sites in the UK. The site had moved to a new technical platform nine months before which included a new design.

This project was a visual refresh on the existing platform taking in response to user feedback about the existing design. A key requirement was a new 'Forecast grid' content object displaying the next 5 days weather summary and providing a mechanism to get detailed weather information for a particular day.

The project was delivered to a very tight deadline.
